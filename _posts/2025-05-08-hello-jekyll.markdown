Hello, my name is [TakaakiU](https://github.com/takaakiu){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

I've created this website using **Jekyll** and **GitHub Pages** (github.io), which I've been interested in for some time. For the Jekyll theme, I used a multilingual-friendly theme called "**[Mr. Green](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop/MrGreen-JekyllTheme){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}**."

Thanks to the developer of the theme, who shared detailed instructions on social media, the process was much easier than I expected. I'll share what I did here as a personal reference.

## Overview

### GitHub Pages

"GitHub Pages allows you to publish a website based on a repository on GitHub."

And the best part? **Even free plans let you use it without any costs.** Kudos to GitHub for their generosity!  

<details markdown="1">

<summary>Original Text: What is GitHub Pages? | GitHub Official (Click here to expand)</summary>

```
You can use GitHub Pages to host a website about yourself, your organization, or your project directly from a repository on GitHub.

Source: [What is GitHub Pages?](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
```

</details>

#### Usage Limits

> GitHub Pages sites are subject to the following usage limits:
> 
> - You can only create one user or organization site for each account on GitHub.
> - GitHub Pages source repositories have a recommended limit of 1 GB. For more information, see [About large files on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#file-and-repository-size-limitations){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.
> - Published GitHub Pages sites may be no larger than 1 GB.
> - GitHub Pages deployments will timeout if they take longer than 10 minutes.
> - GitHub Pages sites have a soft bandwidth limit of 100 GB per month.
> - GitHub Pages sites have a soft limit of 10 builds per hour. This limit does not apply if you build and publish your site with a custom GitHub Actions workflow.
> - In order to provide consistent quality of service for all GitHub Pages sites, rate limits may apply. These rate limits are not intended to interfere with legitimate uses of GitHub Pages. If your request triggers rate limiting, you will receive an appropriate response with an HTTP status code of 429, along with an informative HTML body.
> 
> Source：[GitHub Pages limits](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/github-pages-limits){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

Although there are various limitations, it seems quite feasible to operate a simple personal site without any issues.

### Jekyll

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} - pronounced as "Jekyll."

> Jekyll was first released in 2008 by Tom Preston-Werner. Later, Parker Moore, a GitHub employee, took over the project and led the release of Jekyll 1.  
>  
> Jekyll initiated the trend of static website development. By 2017, Jekyll became one of the most popular static site generators, largely due to its adoption by GitHub. The Jekyll project on GitHub continues to be actively maintained, with regular releases for bug fixes.  
>  
> Source: [Jekyll - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jekyll_(software)#History){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

As mentioned [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, GitHub's official documentation provides guidance on creating a site with Jekyll.

#### Jekyll Themes "Mr.Green"

Jekyll offers a wide variety of themes. Among them, I chose the visually appealing and multilingual-friendly theme called "[Mr. Green](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop/MrGreen-JekyllTheme){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}."

I believe I came across it through keywords like "[Jekyll + theme + Japanese support + multilingual](https://www.google.com/search?q=Jekyll+theme+Japanese+support+multilingual){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer}" where an official article ranked high in the search results.

Additionally, I found [this site](https://blog.ingen084.net/posts/2023-06-18-renew-again){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and thought the theme looked neat and well-organized.

If you're looking for other themes, you can explore [this official article](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer}. If you need specific features, leveraging search engines or generative AI might yield highly relevant results.

## Build Process

### Prerequisites

- A GitHub account is already created
- An active internet connection

### Steps

I followed [this guide](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop/MrGreen-JekyllTheme/blob/main/README.md#github-pages){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} provided by Mr. Green's official documentation.

1. [Fork the official Mr. Green repository](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop/MrGreen-JekyllTheme/fork){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}

2. After forking, change the `url` in `_config.yml`

   ```diff
   - url: "https://your_github_user_name.github.io"
   + url: "https://takaakiu.github.io"
   ```

   → You can view my actual `_config.yml` [here](https://github.com/takaakiu/takaakiu.github.io/blob/main/_config.yml){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

3. Rename the forked repository to `takaakiu.github.io`

   Here, `takaakiu` represents **your GitHub username**. Replace it with your own username.
   [Reference: How to rename a repository | GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/renaming-a-repository){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.

4. Confirm that deployment automatically starts in the `Actions` tab of the forked repository

   You can check the Actions of my repository [here](https://github.com/TakaakiU/takaakiu.github.io/actions){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}.  
   From what I recall, it took quite a bit of time—around 15 to 20 minutes. Be patient and wait for the process to complete.

5. Verify that the deployment has completed successfully by checking for a green checkmark after the yellow "in progress" icon.

6. Check if the URL below is accessible:

   The URL is `https://takaakiu.github.io`. Replace `takaakiu` with **your GitHub username**.

7. And you're done!

   Now you can customize the site to suit your needs. For reference, I’ve shared the changes I made below.

### Customizations (As of May 7, 2025)

I retrieved the differences between the original fork source (official Jekyll theme repository) and my forked repository.  
The main changes include restricting it to English and Japanese and making minor visual adjustments.

Below are the results of comparing the directory structures before and after the Fork.

          #### Paragraph

          **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
          Admit impediments. Love is not love
          Which alters when it alteration finds,
          Or bends with the remover to remove.
          O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
          That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
          It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
          Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
          Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
          Within his bending sickle's compass come;
          Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
          But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
          If this be error and upon me proved,
          I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

          #### Texts

          Quoted text `Hello world`

          Which alters when it alteration finds,
          Or bends with the remover to remove.

          **William Shakespeare**, Let me not to the marriage of true minds
          Admit impediments. Love is not love
          Which alters when it alteration finds,
          Or bends with the remover to remove.
          O no, it is an ever-fixed mark
          That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
          It is the star to every wand'ring barque,
          Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
          Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
          Within his bending sickle's compass come;
          Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
          But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
          If this be error and upon me proved,
          I never writ, nor no man ever loved.

## Summary

- This site was built using the following technologies:
  - **GitHub Pages**  
    A service that allows you to publish static websites for free based on a GitHub repository. It requires no configuration and supports automatic deployment, making it ideal for personal sites and blogs.
  - **Jekyll**  
    A tool that converts Markdown and HTML files into static websites. It is officially supported by GitHub Pages, making integration seamless. Simply push to the repository, and the site can be easily published. Perfect for simple, fast web development.
  - **Jekyll Theme "Mr. Green"**  
    While the developer's name couldn’t be identified, this Jekyll theme was developed by [@MrGreensWorkshop](https://github.com/MrGreensWorkshop).
    Released in 2022, it supports multilingual functionality, allowing users to add languages not included in the official repository.  
    Although I haven’t tried it yet, examining the configuration files suggests it can integrate with Google Analytics and Google Search Console.
