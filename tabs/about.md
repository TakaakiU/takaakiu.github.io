## Strengths & Philosophy

While I enjoy keeping up with the latest technologies, in a professional context, I prioritize the **optimization of TCO (Total Cost of Ownership)** by comprehensively considering various real-world constraints such as human resources, costs, and operational needs.

My philosophy is not to push forward based on technical correctness alone, but to carefully listen to the concerns and expectations of each stakeholder. For instance, I practice tailored communication, such as demonstrating ease of operation to the maintenance team or presenting cost-effectiveness with concrete data to management.

I excel at leading discussions to **constructive conclusions** with a strong focus on TCO.
