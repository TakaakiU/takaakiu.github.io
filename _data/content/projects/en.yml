        ※ Updates to be reflected after verification.

        ## Usage

        To be documented.

        ## Notes

        The following content will be transferred to [personal website](https://takaakiu.github.io) for project management and will be removed from README.

        ### Feature Specifications

        - **Generate Ranking Table**
          - Perform round-robin comparisons (repeatedly choosing between two options) and ultimately generate a ranking table for evaluation targets.
          - Designed for ToC use.
        - **User Authentication**
          - **Google Account Login:** Use Firebase Authentication to allow users to log in with Google accounts. ~~Profile editing and viewing user operation history are possible~~ (currently, not implemented).
          - **Guest Account Login (Anonymous):** Use anonymous authentication to allow login without saving user operation history.
          - ~~**Apple Account Login:**~~ (currently not implemented).
        - **Master Management of Themes (Projects)**
          - Themes (projects) for round-robin comparison are managed in the format of **text** or ~~**text + image**~~ (currently not implemented).
        - ~~**Image Management:**~~ (currently not implemented).
          - User-uploaded images are managed with Firebase Storage.
          - Cloud Functions may process image compression and resizing as needed.

        ---

        ### Development Flow

        - **Design and Requirements Definition**
          - Organize feature lists (round-robin comparison, login authentication, project management, etc.).
          - Screen design (wireframes, UI/UX design) and selection of technologies to use (Firebase suite, Flutter).
        - **Environment Setup**
          - Set up Flutter (Dart) development environment on Windows with Flutter SDK and develop using VS Code.
          - Build Flutter (Dart) development environment on MacOS as well (using Docker for MacOS containers).
          - Create Firebase projects and configure services such as Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions.
          - Install necessary Flutter packages (`firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`, etc.).
        - **User Authentication Implementation**
          - Implement Google login and Apple login using Firebase Authentication.
            Web and Apple platforms support Google Account, Apple Account, and Guest login, while Android supports Google Account and Guest login.
          - Implement anonymous (guest) login and settings to prevent saving user history.
        - **Round-Robin Comparison Feature Implementation**
          - Design for storing project data in Firestore.
          - Perform round-robin comparison and ranking logic via Firebase Functions or client-side logic.
        - **Image Upload Feature Implementation**
          - Build image upload UI on Flutter side and link with Firebase Storage.
          - Add image processing functions using Cloud Functions if needed.
        - **Testing & Debugging**
          - Conduct unit tests and UI tests to verify the operation of each feature.
          - Validate behavior during guest user usage (e.g., history not being saved).
        - **Deployment and Operation**
          - Streamline release procedures for Firebase Hosting and publishing to App Store/Play Store.
          - Design monitoring operations using Firebase Analytics and Crashlytics.

        ### Cost Management & Free Plan Utilization with Access Control

        - **Free Plan Utilization**
          - Flutter (Dart) itself is free.
          - Firebase Spark Plan allows use of **Authentication, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Hosting** within free quota.
        - **Access Control During Paid Plan Activation**
          - **Firestore Security Rules:** Implement data read/write controls based on user payment status (flag management?).
          - **Firebase Functions:** Check user payment status and show error messages or stop processes if free plan limits are exceeded.
          - **Flutter App UI Control:** For features requiring payment, implement UI restrictions so they are not visible or operable for free users.

        ---

        ## Future Implementations

        - Revise UI/UX
            Modernize the look from its current initial state.
        - Implement login with Apple Account
            ※ Requires Apple Developer contracts and others.
        - User Management Features
            Add profile editing, viewing user operation history, and account deletion (control of data linked to deleted accounts as well).
        - Add images to themes during creation
            Implement features using Firebase Storage. While Spark Plan reportedly supports this, the console shows "Upgrade to paid plan," indicating it might require payment.
        - Transition development environment
            Currently developing primarily in Windows with Flutter SDK installed, but plan to transition to MacOS + Docker environment.
        - Publish on Firebase Hosting
        - Apply to Google Store (Google Play) and Apple Store

        ### **1. Development Structure**

        ### **Frontend**

        - **Language/Framework:** Flutter (Dart)
        - **UI Components:** `Material` or `Cupertino` widgets
        - **State Management:** `Riverpod` / `Bloc`
        - **Packages:**
          - `firebase_auth` (User authentication)
          - `cloud_firestore` (Rank table data management)
          - `firebase_storage` (Image management)
          - `flutter_hooks`, `provider` (State management support)

        ### **Backend**

        - **Authentication:** Firebase Authentication
        - **Database:** Firestore
        - **Storage:** Firebase Storage
        - **Cloud Processing:** Firebase Functions
        - **Containerization:** Unified development environment with Docker

        ---

        ### **2. Points for Docker Introduction**

        1. **Containerization of Flutter Development Environment**
          - Use `flutter` official Docker image or build a custom environment.
          - **Local Execution:** Utilize `Docker Compose` to manage app and backend.
          - **CI/CD:** Integrate Docker-based builds with GitHub Actions.
        2. **Firebase Development**
          - Manage `firebase-tools` within the Docker image.
          - Set up emulator environments for Firestore / Authentication.
        3. **Flutter App Deployment**
          - **Web Version:** Deploy to `Firebase Hosting` (managed through Docker).
          - **Mobile Version:** Build and test using `docker run`.
        4. **Backend Unification**
          - Containerize **Node.js-based Firebase Functions** and build a local environment.
          - Cloud Functions handle image processing within execution.
